This study examines a new application of eHMIs, namely the provision of direction information to pedestrians in scenarios where the pedestrian is almost hit by a car. In an experiment, car drivers and pedestrians interacted in the same virtual world, where the pedestrian had to cross the road as the car driver approached. The results showed that the directional eHMI caused pedestrians to step back and produced a tendency towards fewer crashes compared to no eHMI. The eHMI increased the pedestrians’ self-reported understanding of what the car was going to do, although some pedestrians did not notice the eHMI.
